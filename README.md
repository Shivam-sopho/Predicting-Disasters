# Prediction and Management of Natural Disasters using Cutting Edge Tech: Blockchain and Machine Learning
<hr>

## What is the plan to build?  
The project is divided into two parts:
- Prediction of earthquake using machine learning.
- Reducing the impact of a natural disaster using blockchain.
## How does it work?
#### Part 1: Prediction of earthquake using machine learning:  
- Using historical data, a machine learning model is to be built.
- This model will predict the likelihood of an earthquake, given seismic parameters given in the data.
- Models as simple as linear models to complex deep neural networks are to be trained and tested for the problem, whichever works best.
#### Part 2: Reducing the impact of a natural disaster using blockchain:
We have identified two problems post a natural disaster. They are as follows along wih their respective solutions:
- <b>Tracking relief funds and donations using blockchain technology</b>:  
1. During a disaster, relief funds and donations pour in. But, they are scattered across different organizations. 
2. It takes a lot of time for the funds to reach the victims. So, to speed up the process, we propose a solution using blockchain technology and smart contracts.
3. We have 3 types of users on the blockchain network - aid organization (E.g. UNICEF, WHO, etc.), government organizations and local relief personnel.
4. When funds come in, those in need directly get the funds without any hassle and intermediaries using auto-generated smart contracts.  
- <b>Providing transparency and efficient communication among various organizations involved in relief operations:-</b>
1. Employing federated systems is the traditional approach to multi-party operations. Their technological complexity makes them difficult to set up in situations where there is literally no time to lose.
2. In addition, there are security risks involved that make partners hesitant to provide insights into their resource capacities.
3. Imagine the following: The French, who contribute with medical support to a relief mission, want to bring doctors to a certain area of the island, but they have no idea how. Meanwhile, the U.S. has three nearby helicopters to offer. How can both sides immediately know that their requirements and offerings match?
4. Establishing a shared system of record can advance disaster response while also addressing challenges such as ownership of the system and data sovereignty of all involved.
3. Disaster situations call for the absolute transparency, seamless interoperability, and information exchange in real time among helping parties that only a distributed network can provide. This is where blockchain comes in.

## User Interaction with project.
- Natural Disaster authorities will use the prediction model to get predictions related to earthquakes.
- Relief agencies and organizations have a web based interface on a secure, decentralized blockchain network for interaction among them.
## Dataset(s) will be used.
